Syncing Repositories

GitHub -> Remote Repositories (Remotes)

In GitHub you have to make an empty repository first
	Add -> New repository
	reflections

Add this repository as a remote to the reflections repository already on my
computer.
	git remote
	To view a remote
	git remote -v
	To view the complete URL of the remote
	git remote add name_to_refer_to_rep_on_GitHub url_of_remote
	               'origin' is the standard name  https://github.com/kiara-ottogalli/reflections.git (on GitHub page)
	To actually add the remote

git push name_of_remote_rep name_of_local_branch
To send my changes to the remote, takes two arguments: 1) The remote I want to
send changes to and 2) The name of the local branch that i'd like to push.
In this case it will be
	git push origin master

To save the credentials on my computer (windows):
git config --global credential.helper wincred

You can add changes in github, they will not be present in your local repository

1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
   work local?

The remote is useful to keep my work on the cloud and access it from any
computer. Also it allows to work with other people from another location.
