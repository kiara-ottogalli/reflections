Syncing Repositories

GitHub -> Remote Repositories (Remotes)

In GitHub you have to make an empty repository first
	Add -> New repository
	reflections

Add this repository as a remote to the reflections repository already on my
computer.
	git remote
	To view a remote
	git remote -v
	To view the complete URL of the remote
	git remote add name_to_refer_to_rep_on_GitHub url_of_remote
	               'origin' is the standard name  https://github.com/kiara-ottogalli/reflections.git (on GitHub page)
	To actually add the remote

git push name_of_remote_rep name_of_local_branch
To send my changes to the remote, takes two arguments: 1) The remote I want to
send changes to and 2) The name of the local branch that i'd like to push.
In this case it will be
	git push origin master

To save the credentials on my computer (windows):
git config --global credential.helper wincred

You can add changes in github, they will not be present in your local repository

1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
   work local?

The remote is useful to keep my work on the cloud and access it from any
computer. Also it allows to work with other people from another location.

git pull origin master
To sync the changes done directly in GitHub with the local repository.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
   automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I think that is is particulary useful when there are other people collaborating
with yo on a project, you may want to check the changes first and have the
choice of updating or not.

Forking

It is basically making a clone of some repository on GitHub, directly on GitHub
servers. This allows people to make their own changes, suggest changes to the
original owner of the repository and clone on the local machine you're working.

It is done on the context of GitHub.

Exercise
- Fork this repo: https://github.com/LarryMad/recipes (use fork on GitHub)
- Clone it on your pc: git clone https://github.com/LarryMad/recipes.git
- Run git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/kiara-ottogalli/recipes.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/kiara-ottogalli/recipes.git (push)

3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
   use one instead of another?

Clone: The idea is to copy a repository on your own computer, from GitHub or
from another location on the same computer.
Branch: The idea of a branch is primarily to experiment with the files in the
repository without changing the files on the master branch. It creates another
branch different to master.
Fork: The idea is to copy a repository from another user of GitHub to your own
account, on GitHub too, so you can clone it to your machine and make the
changes you like, without changin the original repository.
